== Frequently Asked Questions ==


Q - I can still see products in the store.

A - The plugin added two additional DIVs on the store and product pages:

<div class="shop_closed">

and:

<div class="shop_closed_after">


Your themes CSS can use these classes to hide store content. For example:

.shop_closed {
    display: none;
}
.shop_closed_after {
    margin: 100px 0;
}
.shop_closed_after::after {
    content: "Sorry, our online store is temporarily closed.";
    font-size: rem-calc(36);
    text-align: center;
}
